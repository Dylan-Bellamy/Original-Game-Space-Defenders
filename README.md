# Orbit Defenders Project

## Project Overview

This video game project is to see how long you can stay alive and protect the Earth! The player must
shoot the enemies before they go past them, and at the same time, try not to crash into the enemies. The
only ways for the player to lose lives are to let asteroids pass by them or get hit by asteroids. Once the
player loses 3 lives, the game is over.

## Instructions

To play this game, you must shoot enemy ships to survive. To spawn bullet 1, press “a” on your
keyboard; to spawn bullet 2, press “d” on your keyboard. To go up, press “w” on your keyboard; to go
down, press “s” on your keyboard.
